The Algorithm&AnalysisCode.ipynb file contains the code for three convex hull algorithms: Jarvis March, Graham Scan and Chan's Algorithm. It also includes the test data genarator and the experimental framework for the analysis. My contribution to this involved the Jarvis March and a part of the Chan's Algorithm. I also developed the TestDataGenarator and ExperimentalFramework classes.

The Report.pdf includes the analysis of all three algorithms and their comparisons. The rest of the files are photos of the graphs on which we based our analysis in the report.
